Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented using Python's Turtle graphics module. This project includes basic game mechanics, such as snake movement, collision detection, scoring, and game-over conditions.
Features

    Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys to navigate up, down, left, and right.
    Food Consumption: The snake grows in length and the score increases each time it consumes food.
    Collision Detection: Game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
    Scoreboard: Displays the current score and a "GAME OVER" message when the game ends.

Files

    main.py: The main script that initializes the game, handles the game loop, and manages the collision detection and scoring.
    snake.py: Defines the Snake class, handling the snakeâ€™s movement, extension, and direction changes.
    food.py: Defines the Food class, responsible for generating and refreshing the food's position.
    scoreboard.py: Manages the display of the score and game-over message.
